# Snake-Game-with-Python


![Snake Game Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aW4jHWYRYeIKXAoxF145fu3lV_ZLOg_7/view?usp=sharing)


### Description
It's a simple, well-known game made using python to double check my knowledge about python and its modules. I have used only two simple modules to make the game which are `random` and `curses`
### To Run The Code
  - Download the code
  - Open the directory that is holding the game in the terminal
  - run this command: `python snake-game.py || python3 snake-game.py`
